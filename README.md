# correctness-of-brackets
Java console application allows to check correctness of brackets.

Class program contains main function. If u want to put strings on validation just put them in Args[]. 

Class stack is my analog for stack constructure. It based on ArrayList, but it has limited size. Also u can choose data type for stack elements (Used generics to construct it). 

Class lineChecker contains main algorythm that validates brackets correctnes. In the end it prints line putted to check and result into console.

Class action is pretty simple controller, that checks if Args is empty, and if not it starts validation for every string u wrote.
